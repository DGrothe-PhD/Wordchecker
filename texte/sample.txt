Optical storage of information is at least as old as writing. Digital data storage and
processing with the help of machines became useful as soon as the population of
the US increased. At the time, it would have taken more than ten years to finish the
statistics of the 63 million people. The invention of punched cards made of stiff paper
and of the tabulating machines by Herman Hollerith vastly accelerated the evaluation
of the US census in the year 1890, which was completed within 18 months [1]. The
idea of using punched paper by machines was not entirely new, it had earlier been
used in Jacquard looms, permitting the industrial production of fabric with arbitrary
patterns. With the introduction of computers, punched cards were more and more
replaced by magnetic tape [1].
Since then, much has changed. Digital technology has found its way into almost every
sphere of our lives. Smartphones are permanently connected to the Internet. Cloud
computing and software as a service offer new ways of computing but may entail new
targets for cyber attacks. Data-centered economy becomes more and more important.
With increasing amounts of data, the demand for high-capacity storage media will
continue growing as well.
